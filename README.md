# 🏥 County Health Tree Model

This project applies decision tree models to analyze county-level public health indicators in the U.S., aiming to identify key risk factors and predict overall health outcomes.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Goal**: Predict county-level health outcomes and reveal interpretable drivers of public health disparities.
- **Method**: CART (Classification and Regression Trees) applied to structured health indicators.
- **Focus**: Smoking rates, obesity, uninsured percentage, education level, income inequality, etc.
